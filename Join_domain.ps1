 Script Name: Join_Domain.ps1
 Created by Cameron McLean for personal use

 Script to join domain & set computer description to username used to join, date of joining & computer manufacturer

 Note - winRM must be running for get-computerinfo to work, perform first time setup with "winrm quickconfig"

 To-Do:  
  -Check if current description starts with underscore, so it's not overwritten if set manually
  -Add logic to save computerinfo to an object so it isn't called twice & check if it returns valid input (wimrm is running)
